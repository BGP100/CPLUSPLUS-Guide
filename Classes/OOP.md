OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.
<br>
Procedural programming is about writing procedures or functions that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and functions.
<br>
Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:
<ul>
  <li>OOP is faster and easier to execute</li>
  <li>OOP provides a clear structure for the programs</li>
  <li>OOP helps to keep the C++ code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug</li>
  <li>OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time</li>
</ul>
<b>Tip:</b> The "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle is about reducing the repetition of code. You should extract out the codes that are common for the application, and place them at a single place and reuse them instead of repeating it.
<h1>What are Classes and Objects?</h1>
Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object-oriented programming.
<br>
Look at the following illustration to see the difference between class and objects:
<br>

<br>
So, a class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of a class.
<br>
When the individual objects are created, they inherit all the variables and functions from the class.

You will learn much more about classes and objects in the next chapter.
