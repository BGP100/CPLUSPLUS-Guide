Learn how to add two numbers in C++:
<pre>
int x = 5;
int y = 6;
int sum = x + y;
cout << sum;
</pre>
<h1>With User Input</h1>
In this example, the user must input two numbers. Then we print the sum by calculating (adding) the two numbers:
<pre>
int x, y;
int sum;
cout << "Type a number: ";
cin >> x;
cout << "Type another number: ";
cin >> y;
sum = x + y;
cout << "Sum is: " << sum;
</pre>
